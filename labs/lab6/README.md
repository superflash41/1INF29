# xrun.c
This code includes the `main` method.

It calls the `xmalloc` method 7 times.

```c
unsigned int x = 0;
do {
	...
	x++;
} while (x <= 6);
```

The goal is to allocate memory multiple times and with different sizes each time: $1.5$, $2.5$, $4.5$, and so on.
# xalloc.c
This code is based on the contents from *The C Programming Language*.
## header
The `header` is the data structure we will use to store the **pointer to the next node** (hole) in the list and the **actual size of the node** measured in `Align` units.

```c
typedef long Align;

union header {
	struct {
		union header* ptr;
		size_t size;
	} s;
	Align x;
};

typedef union header Header;
```
## base
Is the fake hole that serves as the start of the list.

```c
static Header base;
```
## freep
Always points to the previous hole in the list, from where we want to start looking for a hole.

```c
static Header* freep = NULL; // at first there is no previous hole
```
## morecore
Increases the size of the heap with `sbrk`.

```c
static Header* morecore(size_t nu) {
	char* cp;
	Header* up;
	if (nu < NALLOC) nu = NALLOC; // minimmum number of units
	cp = sbrk(nu * sizeof(Header));
	if (cp == (char*)-1) return NULL; // heap cannot keep growing
	up = (Header*)cp; // up is the pointer to the new hole
	up->s.size = nu; // we save the size of the new hole
	xfree((void*)(up+1)); // we add the hole to the list
	return freep;
}
```
## xmalloc
This methods convert the requested number of bytes into a Headers-based size.

**On the first call** it creates a list with a single hole with size $0$ (the *fake* hole). On **following calls**, it iterates through the list.

**If it finds a suitable hole**, takes the needed space from it, and returns the pointer to the data space (to skip the header).

**If it does not find a suitable hole**, it calls the `morecore` method to ask the system for more space. **If this call fails**, the methods just returns `NULL`. **Else**, it gets the requested space (a hole is added to the list), and restarts the search.

```c
void* xmalloc(size_t nbytes) {
	Header* p, *prevp;
	/* we need the size in terms of Headers and rounded by excess */
	size_t nunits = (nbytes + sizeof(Header) - 1) / sizeof(Header) + 1;
	if (!(prev=freep)) {
		base.s.ptr = freep = prevp = &base;
		base.s.size = 0;
	}
	for (p=prev->s.ptr; ; prevp=p, p=p->s.ptr) {
		if (p->s.size >= nunits) { // this hole is big enough
			if (p->s.size == nunits) // the exact size we need
				prev->s.ptr = p->s.ptr; // just 
			else {
				p->s.size -= nunits; // hole has less space
				p += p->s.size; // the pointer goes to the new block
				p->s.size = nunits; // this block has the requested size
			}
			freep = prevp; // 
			return (void*)(p+1); // pointer to the block skipping the header
		}
		if (p==freep) // when returning to freep, asks for more memory
			if (!(p=morecore(nunits))) return NULL; // no memory left :(
	}
}
```
## xfree
This method is explained with detail below.

```c
void xfree(void* ap) {
	Header* p, *bp = (Header*)ap - 1; // bp points to the header of ap
	for (p=freep; !(bp > p && bp < p->s.ptr); p=p->s.ptr)
		if (p >= p->s.ptr && (bp>p || bp < p->s.ptr)) break;
	if (bp + bp->s.size == p->s.ptr) { // normal case or before all
		bp->s.size += p->s.ptr->s.size;
		bp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr->s.ptr;
	} else bp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr; // link last hole with first hole
	if (p + p->s.size == bp) {
		p->s.size += bp->s.size;
		p->s.ptr = bp->s.ptr;
	} else p->s.ptr = bp;
	freep = p; // the hole before bp, needed for next-fit
}
```

Further explanation of this code:
### what does this loop do????

```c
for (p=freep; !(bp > p && bp < p->s.ptr); p=p->s.ptr)
	if (p >= p->s.ptr && (bp>p || bp < p->s.ptr)) break;
```

We know we need to find two holes: the ones that are before and after `bp`. It can happen two situations:
- *normal* case: `bp` is in the **middle** of the list
- *extreme* case: `bp` is not in the middle of the list, but **on one extreme** (before all the holes, or after all the holes) based on its memory address

![img](guide/assets/img.png)

To handle this situation, when we iterate trough the list we need to identify the two moments where we can stop.

- for the *normal* case: we stop when `bp > p` and `bp < p->s.ptr`. because it will mean the hole to insert is between two holes in the middle of the list. **this is why in the code this is called as the *normal* exit of the loop.**
- for the *extreme* case: if at any point during the loop, `p` points to an address higher than `p->s.ptr`, it would mean we have reached the *extreme* case. then we check if `bp > p` (`bp` is *after* the last hole) or if `bp < p->s.ptr` (`bp` is *before* all the holes). if this two things happen at the same time then we are sure we are in the *extreme* case, so we have found `p` and we can exit the loop. **this corresponds to the `if` block with a `break` statement.**

### what are the ifs for?
Ok, **we know the value of `p` (previous hole's address) and `p->s.ptr` (next hole's address)**. so now we must connect our new hole (`bp`) into the list. how to do so?

first **lets connect it to the next hole** (`p->s.ptr`):

```c
if (bp + bp->s.size == p->s.ptr) { // normal case or before all
	bp->s.size += p->s.ptr->s.size;
	bp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr->s.ptr;
} else bp->s.ptr = p->s.ptr; // link last hole with first hole
```

- if the next hole is *before* `bp` (at a higher memory address) it means we need to **increment the size of the hole** (`+=`) and **connect its following hole** (`p->s.ptr->s.ptr`).
- if the hole is *after* `bp` (at a lower memory address) it means `bp` is at the bottom, so we **just connect it with the next hole**

something similar happens when connecting it to the previous hole (`p`):

```c
if (p + p->s.size == bp) {
	p->s.size += bp->s.size;
	p->s.ptr = bp->s.ptr;
} else p->s.ptr = bp;
```

- if `bp` is *after* `p` (at a higher memory address) it means we need to **increment the size of the hole `p`** (`+=`) and **connect it to `bp`'s following hole** (`bp->s.ptr`).
- if `bp` is *before* `p` (at a lower memory address) it means `bp` is at the beginning of the list, so we **just connect `p` with `bp`**
