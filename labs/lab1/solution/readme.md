To run this one just use the following command:
```shell
./script1.sh 100 130 2
```
## `script2.sh`
First move the `.odt` files from [this directory](https://github.com/superflash41/1INF29/tree/main/labs/lab1/source/question2) to the actual directory. Then, use the following command and see how the names of the files change.
```shell
